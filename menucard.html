                    In the authentic Awadhi chicken biryani recipe, rice and meat are cooked separately before being placed in layers in a pot, which is then sealed and allowed to cook gradually over low heat for many hours. Its gentle and delicate flavour distinguishes it from other types of biryani in the Indian subcontinent.

                    Add pureed tomatoes and Rasoi Magic Paneer Tikka Masala spice mix, salt, dry fenugreek leaves and cover and cook for 15 mins on a medium heat. Once the spices and tomatoes are cooked through, add a cup of water and bring the sauce to a boil.
                    Add the grilled paneer, vegetables and its cooked juices and mix well. Simmer the sauce for 5 minutes, check for seasoning and adjust if required. Stir in the fresh cream, lemon juice, fresh coriander leaves and remove from heat.

                    Egg fried rice. Deceptively simple, but a huge favorite and crowd-pleaser. My egg fried rice recipe uses egg that’s slightly flavored with turmeric and paprika, which I think is a unique addition. It adds color to the dish, making it a vibrant yellow. (If you’re used to a Chinese takeout place that makes their fried rice yellow, you can be sure they were probably using food coloring. Using turmeric gets you that same color at home with a natural ingredient.)

                    Butter garlic naan is a traditional Indian flatbread and one of the most popular versions of naan. It’s made with flour, yeast, salt, sugar, and yogurt. Once the dough has been baked in a hot tandoor oven, the golden naan is taken out and brushed with butter or ghee, then topped with minced garlic.
                    It's recommended to serve butter garlic naan with a variety of Indian dishes such as curries, butter chicken, dal makhani, malai kofta, or shahi paneer.

                    The flavour combination of strawberries and lime are delicious.  Add cream and tequila and you have me purring like my big fat ginger cat!   It’s the next best thing to a frozen strawberry margarita.

                    Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is either rolled flat and cut, stretched, or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures (for example, Chinese noodles, Filipino noodles, Indonesian noodles, Japanese noodles, Korean noodles, Vietnamese noodles, and long and medium length Italian pasta) and made into a variety of shapes.
